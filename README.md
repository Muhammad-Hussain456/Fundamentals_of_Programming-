# Fundamentals of Programming


## Topics to Study

Course introduction — algorithms, flowcharts, pseudocode, overview of programming languages, introduction to C++.


Fundamentals of C++ — program structure, variables, assignments, input/output operations, data types, type conversions.


Operators and expressions — arithmetic, assignment, increment/decrement, relational and logical operators, precedence.


Control structures I (selection statements) — logical expressions, if, else, nested if, switch.


Control structures II (loops) — for, while, do‑while, nested loops.


Arrays — one‑dimensional and multi‑dimensional arrays, array operations, passing arrays to functions.


Functions — defining/calling functions, passing arguments (by value/reference), return values, scope/lifetime, recursion.


Strings — string declaration/initialization, literals, C string library, arrays of strings, std::string usage.


Structures — struct declaration/initialization, array of structs, nested structs, structs with functions, pointers to structs.


File handling — opening/closing files, reading/writing text and binary files, file streams (ifstream, ofstream, fstream).


Introduction to pointers — basic pointer usage, pointers and arrays, pointers with functions and structures.
